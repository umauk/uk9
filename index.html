            <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
            <p> is simply dummy text of th0e printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                <h1>Where does it come from?</h1>
            <p>ond film with Kalyan after Tholi Prema. This film was produced by C. Ashwini Dutt under Vyjayanthi Movies banner.

                In 2006, Bangaram, directed by Tamil director Dharani was released. During March 2006, Kalyan launched his second directorial venture Satyagrahi, produced by A. M. Rathnam, which would be a tale questioning the atrocities in society. After spending a few months on pre-production by signing with P. C. Sreeram and A. R. Rahman, the film was later suddenly shelved.[33] Later that year, he appeared in Annavaram, directed by Bhimaneni Srinivasa Rao. Asin, and Sandhya were cast alongside Kalyan in the film and the film was produced under Super Good Films. The film was released on 29 December 2006[34] and collected ₹23 crore (US$2.9 million) in 3 weeks and ₹300 million (US$3.8 million) in 70 Days.[35][36] The film was a remake of the Tamil film Thirupaachi. Kalyan also choreographed the song "Neevalle Neevalle" in this film.
                
                In 2008, Jalsa, directed by Trivikram Srinivas and produced by Allu Aravind was released on 2 April. This film got the highest first-day collection in Telugu film history and was also the first for any regional film in south India in a single state by that time.[37] Jalsa turned out to be the highest grosser of 2008 in Telugu cinema.[38] Puli was written and directed by S. J. Suryah and released in 2010. An official announcement was made in the same year that Kalyan was going to play a small role in a movie about Jesus Christ directed by Singeetam Srinivasa Rao.[39] In 2011, he appeared in Teen Maar, a remake of Love Aaj Kal, directed by Jayanth C. Paranjee.[40] He also appeared in Vishnuvardhan's gangster film Panjaa.[41][42]
                
                In 2012, he appeared in Gabbar Singh, a remake of Dabangg, directed by Harish Shankar.[43] The film successfully completed 100 days and stood as the second highest-grossing Telugu film at that time.[44][45] After this film, he worked in Puri Jagannadh's Cameraman Gangatho Rambabu.
                
                In 2013, he appeared in Trivikram Srinivas's Attarintiki Daredi. The film, released on 27 September 2013, faced problems with piracy as half of the movie was leaked to the internet prior to its release.[46] In spite of this the movie was a blockbuster in 2013. The movie completed 100 days in 33 theaters and held the record of the highest-grossing film in Tollywood by that time, surpassing the previous record of Magadheera.[47] Later, it was surpassed by Baahubali: The Beginning.
                
                In 2014, a Star India survey ranked Kalyan as one of the Top 5 Heroes of India.[48] In 2015, he appeared in Gopala Gopala, a Telugu remake of OMG – Oh My God!.[49] The film featured Kalyan starring alongside Venkatesh and was directed by Kishore Kumar Pardasani. In 2016, Kalyan's Sardaar Gabbar Singh, a sequel to his 2012 film Gabbar Singh received poor reviews from critics.[citation needed] Katamarayudu (2017), a remake of Tamil film Veeram marked his second collaboration with Kishore Kumar Pardasani. In 2018, he appeared in the film Agnyaathavaasi directed by Trivikram Srinivas. This marked Kalyan's 25th film.
                
                In 2021, he made a comeback to films by appearing in Vakeel Saab, directed by Venu Sriram. He announced Hari Hara Veera Mallu, which is being directed by Krish Jagarlamudi. The shooting of the film has currently been on hold for almost 2 years, owing to Kalyan's political commitments. Mythri Movie Makers also announced Ustaad Bhagat Singh with Kalyan, under the direction of Harish Shankar.[50] He also acted in the remake of Vinodhaya Sitham, Bro, with Sai Dharam Tej, under the direction of Samuthirakani, who also directed the original film. Another film, They Call Him OG, was subsequently announced with Sujeeth as the director and to be produced by D. V. V. Danayya.Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

                <p id="c"></p><h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
                <p >t is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
